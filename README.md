This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug involving type mismatches in component props. The `Bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `BugSolution.js` provides the corrected implementation.  The error arises when a component receives an unexpected prop type, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. Understanding prop types is crucial for building robust React Native applications.
